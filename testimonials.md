### "Skilled and Efficient ArcGIS Consultant - Language Needs Analysis"
> **Quote:** "I hired Charles as a GIS Specialist to map various Census data points and other data in a variety of ArcGIS layers around the City of Los Angeles for a project my firm is leading. Layers included: local libraries, city council districts, Limited English Proficiency language speakers in the area (Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Tagalog, Armenian, Russian, and Persian), low income data, and renter data in the area. **Charles was FANTASTIC**. He brought my vision to life and gave us above and beyond what we expected. He was also extremely kind, very available, and quick to provide deliverables. He even provided us with how to videos to help us navigate the maps he created. **I cannot speak highly enough of him and his work. 20 out of 10 recommend!** Thank you Charles!" | - Tracey S. (Vice President)


- **Summary of Original Project Request:** Seeking an experienced ArcGIS consultant to analyze and map the top languages spoken by low-income, limited English proficiency households in Los Angeles, CA. The analysis should specify languages beyond broad categories, such as distinguishing between Chinese and Korean. The project requires mapping both collectively and individually by language, identifying areas with significant language needs, and providing a written report highlighting the top census tracts and zip codes. This project is time-sensitive due to previous delays.<br>
- **Project Deliverables:** Around a dozen static and interactive maps detailing the distribution of spoken language in Los Angeles in relation to public libraries. Maps were made available in ArcGIS Online, as individual PDFs, and as large-scale poster boards.   <br>

### "GIS Specialist for Visualization, Analysis and Design"
> **Quote**: "CJ helped my team out with a tedious research project. The project required calling and speaking with schools, and hospitals in Georgia to collect population information from them. The data collected via calls was merged with the 2020 census data. The final deliverable had to be made in a GIS-friendly format. Throughout the project, CJ was reliable and communicative. CJ worked independently and delivered quality GIS data and metadata. CJ was even able to complete the research project ahead of schedule. **I would recommend CJ's talents to anyone in need of some GIS, research, or data assistance!**" | - Kira G. (Technical Customer Success)

### "Help with Geo-Spatial Data"
>**Quote:** "I was working with Charles on a specific project in regards to electric mobility and geo spacial data, turned out that Charles is a highly motivated researcher and very savvy. Although we were facing some initial stumbling stones from data side, he managed to find a solution within due time and accomplished the task within days. The communication with Charles was almost in real time and he was very responsive to my input. **He delivered exactly what I needed, I will definitely hire him again!**" | - Maria F. (Marketing Manager)


- **Summary of Original Project Request:** I have a JSON file with detailed information on POS (Point of Sales), including geospatial data. I need an analysis of the defined perimeter around three urban areas to identify what is within these perimeters based on the available data. This includes calculating average distances between POS and categorizing them by type. The final output should evaluate the quality of the facilities within these perimeters. Additionally, suggestions for visualizing the results and delivering maps or graphs would be appreciated.
- **Project Deliverables:** A site selection report identifying where to release sustainability products based on quality of fit ranking. Visuals provided also included static and interactive choropleth maps of suggested locations.
